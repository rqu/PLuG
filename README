The DiSL language is hosted in Java using annotations, therefore, no special compiler is required.
A convenient way to specify an instrumentation and to pass it to the DiSL framework is to pack the instrumentation classes with a manifest file into one jar.
The DiSL framework will load the jar, parse the instrumentation specification, and instrument all classes used by an application at load-time.

The examples of simple instrumentation are in src-test directory.
The test can be invoked using runTest.sh script in the root directory.
For user defined instrumentation, it is recommended to mimic the start and build script as they are provided for the tests.
We are working on better setup scripts to ease the setup effort for developer.

The supported platform is Linux with installed Java and GCC.

To compile DiSL please run the "ant" command in the root directory and "make" in the src-agent-c directory.
If the make is complaining about missing java headers, modify the Makefile.local.tmpl accordingly.
