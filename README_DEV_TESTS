Overview
========

Tests are implemented using JUnit. There are classic unit tests that are
located in the ch.usi.dag.disl.test2.junit package and complex tests in the
ch.usi.dag.disl.test2.suite package that invoke all parts of the framework
(client, server, ...) and verify computed results.

All tests are performed calling
- ant test2

To use the for debuging purpose during development a single suite test (for
example "after" test) can be invoked calling
- ant suite-test2 -Dtest2.name=after

Parameters can specified to ant at command line starting with "-Ddisl." are
passed to the test. For example to show tests output specify 
- -Ddisl.test.verbose=true

When built with "ant prepare-test2" tests can be also run directly. They are
packed in the "build-test" directory.
