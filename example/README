DiSL SETUP EXAMPLE
==================

This simple example illustrates a basic instrumentation setup. It shows, how
the instrumentation should be packaged and contains a scripts that should ease
running DiSL together with your program.

The example contains simple user application that prints hello string on
command line and instrumentation printing strings before and after application
main.

HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE
======================

First be sure that you compiled DiSL (see README in the root directory). Then
follow the steps:

1) compile application calling "ant" in the app directory
2) compile instrumentation calling "ant" in the instrumentation directory
3) run "runApp.sh ./runApp.sh instr/build/disl-instr.jar -jar app/build/example-app.jar"

The last command starts the application together with DiSL. The output of the
application and the applied instrumentation should be visible on command line.

NOTE: If you want to use "runApp.sh" to run your application, don't forget to set
      "DISL_LIB_P" variable correctly. Also, you can modify DiSL setting in
      "runServer.sh".

NOTE: If you want to include use some library in your instrumentation you shlould
      insert it directly to the instrumentation jar using jarjar.
