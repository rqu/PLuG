DiSL SETUP EXAMPLE
==================

This simple example illustrates a basic instrumentation setup. It shows, how
the instrumentation should be packaged and contains a scripts that should ease
running DiSL together with your program.

The example contains simple user application that prints hello string on
command line and instrumentation printing strings before and after application
main.


HOW TO RUN THE EXAMPLE 
======================

First be sure that you compiled DiSL (see README in the root directory). Then
follow the steps:

Easiest way to run the example is to execute "ant run".

This command builds and packs the application and the instrumentation
application. And then starts the instrumentation server and later on also the
application

The output of the application and the applied instrumentation should be visible
on command line.

When compiled the example can be also run using "disl.py" script directly. This
enables more detailed settings. To learn more about this run "./disl.py -h"


NOTE 
====

If you want to use "disl.py" to run your application, don't forget to set
"DISL_HOME" variable correctly or it can be specified to "disl.py" at command
line or inside the script as a default value.


NOTE
====

If you want to include use some library in your instrumentation you
shlould insert it directly to the instrumentation jar using jarjar.
